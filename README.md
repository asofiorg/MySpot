MySpot is a revolutionary software that allows you to transform any device, such as a Raspberry Pi, into a hotspot network that provides offline access to a wealth of educational content, including wikis, dictionaries, and more.

With MySpot, you can easily create a WiFi network that is accessible to anyone within range of the device, making it an ideal solution for libraries, community centers, schools, and other public places.

And because MySpot works offline, it is especially useful for vulnerable populations who may have limited or no internet access, or face slow, expensive connections. Simply install MySpot on your device and watch as it becomes a hub of knowledge and connection for all those around you.

## Why?

The most valuable resource in the world is information, it is the key to solve problems, to create new things, to improve the world. But the information is not easylly transmitible, that's why internet exists.

The internet is a great tool that everyone should be able to use, but it is not available everywhere. In some places, it is not even available at all, in others, it is expensive and slow. And this is a really important problem, if we look at the data, the places with less resources are the ones with worse access.

</p>

Based on the data, the most developed countries are the ones with the most stable access (North America, Europe, and Central Asia), and the least developed countries are the ones with the worst access (South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa). But something more interesting is the Sub-Saharan Africa, where services that normally require internet like mobile money are very popular.

</p>

Sub-Saharan Africa almost have the half of the world&apos;s mobile money accounts, but, these places are the ones with the worst internet access, also have the highest rates of mobile money users? The answer is M-PESA (M for mobile, PESA for money), a mobile money service that works through SMS, and it is available in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.

This show us that the information can have multiple ways to reach the people, and the internet is not the only one. So, why not use the alternatives channels to create a tool that can be used offline to use the most esentials features of internet like searching? This is the idea behind MySpot.
